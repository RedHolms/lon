  LON

My own compiled language, similar to C++ or Rust, but better.

Some of future ideas for this language:
  - No runtime. At all. Everything will be in exe itself, importing only win32 dlls.
  - TypeScript-like syntax (I really like it).
  - Chars are chars, not bytes. Strings are really bad in C++. In lon I want to make.
    string type built-in for optimization, and also make it use UTF-32 everywhere (i.e. char in lot = char32_t in c++).
    Built-in string class allows to compile-time encode strings for better performance.
  - Built-in lists (f.e. String[] = std::vector<std::string>). This also allows really good optimizations.
  - Corountimes. It's just really good for performance.
  maybe more later
